Probabilistic timed automata (PTAs) are timed automata extended with discrete probability distributions.
They serve as a mathematical model for a wide range of applications that involve both stochastic and timed behaviours.
In this paper, we study model checking of linear-time temporal properties over PTAs.
In particular, we consider linear-time properties that can be encoded through deterministic timed automata (DTAs) with finite acceptance criterion.
DTAs are a deterministic subclass of timed automata that can recognize a wide range of timed formal languages, thus can be effectively used to specify timed behaviours of systems.
We show that through a product construction, model checking of PTAs against DTA-specifications can be reduced to solving reachability probabilities over PTAs, thus can be effectively solved by known algorithms on PTA-reachability.
Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.
As far as we know, we are the first to consider linear-time model checking of PTAs.
