Probabilistic timed automata (PTAs) are timed automata extended with discrete probability distributions.
They serve as a mathematical model for a wide range of applications that involve both stochastic and timed behaviours.
In this paper, we study the model-checking problem of linear \emph{dense-time} temporal properties over PTAs.
In particular, we consider linear dense-time properties that can be encoded by timed automata with both finite and infinite acceptance criteria.
We first show that the problem of model-checking PTAs against deterministic-timed-automata specifications with infinite acceptance criterion can be solved through a product construction and is EXPTIME-complete.
Then we show that when relaxed to general (nondeterministic) timed automata, the model-checking problem becomes undecidable.
Finally, we investigate the situation where the acceptance criterion is restricted to be finite. 
We show that for deterministic timed automata, the model-checking problem can be solved
using known zone-based algorithms for reachability probabilities on PTAs.
Furthermore, for nondeterministic timed automata, we show an approximation algorithm for solving the problem whose correctness is based on a translation to infinite-state Markov decision processes.
