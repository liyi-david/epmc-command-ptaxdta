1. [x] One limitation is there are no examples of properties that are useful in practice and cannot be expressed in, for example, PTCTL or discrete time Rabin automata.

这个我们估计没时间。

2. [x] Also, there is something odd going on with the (lack) spacing between text before and after headings.

这个我们目前这样也可以了。你看一下能不能改进一下spacing。

3. [o] page 1: reference 1 for real world applications?

我们把real-world 去掉。

4. [o] page 2: is studied -> has been studied, for example,

5. [o] page 2: and therefore -> , and therefore

6. [x] page 2: "to track timing constraints" - not clear

改成 involve timing constraints

"since it requires to involve timing constraints."

7. [x] page 2: TAs are ... - you have already said what PTAs are so do not need this detail again

我们可以把这一行删掉。

8. [o] page 2: to compute the probability -> of computing the minimum or maximum probability

9. [o] page 3: many times -> often

10.[o] page 3: (i.e. b_i's) - delete

11.[o] page 3: form (1) -> this is not need you have defined what a PTA is (so you also do not need the equation numbers)

12.[o] page 4: You should state you restrict to deterministic schedulers and that these are sufficient (although memory is required for omega regular properties)

可以提一下，就说deteterministic schedulers suffices, 并引用一下principles of model checking这本书关于概率系统的那一章。

改为 Schedulers. A (deteterministic) scheduler is a function ...

再写句子又篇幅又长了。

13.[x] page 4: in the equation sigma(s_0...s_k) can be replaced with a_{k+1} (可能保持现状比较容易读吧)

就保持现状吧。

14.[x] page 5: you do not need the d_i's you can just sum over the odd values of a_i's as you do later

这个不改也没关系。

15.[o] page 5: two dot points - not clear 改为 “The two dots together with their corresponding solid line and dashed arrows refer to two actions...”

16.[o] page 6: explain why a TA does not have invariants
17.[o] page 6: give some discussion of determinacy and totality after the definition

在第六页定义2后面加上这一段：Informally, A TA is deterministic if there is always exactly one rule applicable for the timed transition. 
We do not incorporate invariants in TAs as we use TAs as language acceptors. 

18.[x] page 6: (q,v) - you use v for PTA so would be better to use different notation for clock valuations of TAs?

这个我们没时间调整了。

19.[o] page 6: reference to Rabin acceptance 我在 Definition 3 的标题引一下 Principles of Model Checking

18.[x] page 6: add some examples of what can be encoded

这个估计我们也没时间。

19.[o] page 7: explain actions are sets of atomic propositions （Example 2 里面介绍字母表是 AP 幂集）

20.[o] page 7: the discussion of the example is very confusing and need improvement

21.[o] page 7: difference to flip alpha and beta - reword

改成： where the only difference is to flip ... 

22.[o] page 7: From *the* Rabin

23.[o] page 7: in the problem statement you need to state minimum or maximum probability "and computes the minimum and the maximum probability that infinite paths under the PTA are accepted by the TRA."

24.[x] page 7/8: what does "internal actions", "internal behaviours" and "external behaviours" mean?

这个我们已经解释了。

25.[o] page 8: pi under C -> pi of C

26.[o] page 8: more details on the measurability would be helpful (either in the text or in the appendix)
我们以前写过这个公式,后来删掉了

\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
   &
   \LangCsAqF = \\
       \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} (
           &
           \bigcup_{m \in \Nset}
           \bigcap \left \{
               \overline{\cyl(\fnpath)}
               \mid
               \fnpath \in \fnpaths{\pta,\sigma}
               \mbox{,}
               m \le \length{\fnpath}
               \mbox{,}
               \lastloc{
                   \traj{
                       \run{\tra}{\iconfig}{\lbfunc(\fnpath)}
                   }
               } \in H_i
           \right \}
           \\
           \cap
           &
           \bigcap_{m \in \Nset}
           \bigcup \left \{
               \cyl(\fnpath)

               \mbox{,}
               m \le \length{\fnpath}
               \mbox{,}

                   }
               } \in K_i
           \right \}
       )
\end{align*}
\end{small}
where
$
   \dtloc^*
       =
           \trfunc \left(
               (\dtloc,\zero),
               \lbfunc (
                   \initloc{\fnpath}
           \right)
$.

把这个加到附录里。

27.[x] page 9: tuple of clock constraints - you defined a function?

这个不用管

28.[o] page 9: in the definition of enab have not quantified a (a 是 enab⊗ ((l,q),(a,h))的参数)

把a解释一下（文中for all 右边没有关于a的解释）

29.[o] page 9: in the definition of prob not quantified the states, clock sets etc
评审的意见应该是说介绍一下 l, q, a, h 等等字母是什么。

对，就这样改一下。

30.[x] page 9/10: in example 3 (and hence also the previous examples) having a complete example would help with understanding here (for example knowing what the initial state is)
31.[x] page 10: the long list of functions is not really adding anything, you can just say it is all combinations of ...

这两个有时间就在会议版论文里改一下。 要改的话你根据自己的理解改一下，比如确定一下初始location, 以及如何概括得描述h_1到h_7 

32.[o] page 12: Rabin probabilities - what are these? 改为 “Rabin(-accepting) probabilities”
