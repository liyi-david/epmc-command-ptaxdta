1. [x] One limitation is there are no examples of properties that are useful in practice and cannot be expressed in, for example, PTCTL or discrete time Rabin automata. 

2. [x] Also, there is something odd going on with the (lack) spacing between text before and after headings.


3. [x] page 1: reference 1 for real world applications?

4. [o] page 2: is studied -> has been studied, for example,

5. [o] page 2: and therefore -> , and therefore

6. [x] page 2: "to track timing constraints" - not clear

7. [x] page 2: TAs are ... - you have already said what PTAs are so do not need this detail again

8. [o] page 2: to compute the probability -> of computing the minimum or maximum probability

9. [o] page 3: many times -> often

10.[o] page 3: (i.e. b_i's) - delete

11.[o] page 3: form (1) -> this is not need you have defined what a PTA is (so you also do not need the equation numbers)

12.[x] page 4: You should state you restrict to deterministic schedulers and that these are sufficient (although memory is required for omega regular properties)

13.[x] page 4: in the equation sigma(s_0...s_k) can be replaced with a_{k+1} (可能保持现状比较容易读吧)

14.[x] page 5: you do not need the d_i's you can just sum over the odd values of a_i's as you do later

15.[o] page 5: two dot points - not clear 改为 “The two dots together with their corresponding solid line and dashed arrows refer to two actions...”

16.[x] page 6: explain why a TA does not have invariants

17.[x] page 6: give some discussion of determinacy and totality after the definition

18.[x] page 6: (q,v) - you use v for PTA so would be better to use different notation for clock valuations of TAs?

19.[o] page 6: reference to Rabin acceptance 我在 Definition 3 的标题引一下 Principles of Model Checking

18.[x] page 6: add some examples of what can be encoded

19.[o] page 7: explain actions are sets of atomic propositions （Example 2 里面介绍字母表是 AP 幂集）

20.[o] page 7: the discussion of the example is very confusing and need improvement

21.[x] page 7: difference to flip alpha and beta - reword

22.[o] page 7: From *the* Rabin

23.[o] page 7: in the problem statement you need to state minimum or maximum probability "and computes the minimum and the maximum probability that infinite paths under the PTA are accepted by the TRA."

24.[x] page 7/8: what does "internal actions", "internal behaviours" and "external behaviours" mean?

25.[o] page 8: pi under C -> pi of C

26.[x] page 8: more details on the measurability would be helpful (either in the text or in the appendix)

27.[x] page 9: tuple of clock constraints - you defined a function?

28.[x] page 9: in the definition of enab have not quantified a (a 是 enab⊗ ((l,q),(a,h))的参数)

29.[x] page 9: in the definition of prob not quantified the states, clock sets etc
评审的意见应该是说介绍一下 l, q, a, h 等等字母是什么。

30.[x] page 9/10: in example 3 (and hence also the previous examples) having a complete example would help with understanding here (for example knowing what the initial state is)

31.[x] page 10: the long list of functions is not really adding anything, you can just say it is all combinations of ...

32.[o] page 12: Rabin probabilities - what are these? 改为 “Rabin(-accepting) probabilities”
