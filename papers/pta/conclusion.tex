\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we studied the linear-time model-checking problem {\sc PTA-DTA} of DTA-specifications over PTAs.
To solve the problem, we gave two versions of product construction (between a PTA and a DTA) which both reduce the problem to computing reachability probabilities over PTAs, for which efficient algorithms exist~\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/NormanPS13,DBLP:journals/tcs/KwiatkowskaNSS02}.
Both the product constructions are nontrivial and are elaborated so that one caters for DTAs with a small number of regions and the other for DTAs with small size.
Then we demonstrated two case studies clarifying that the problem PTA-DTA can be applied to real-world applications.
Experimental results show that our product construction is efficient to solve the problem.
A challenging future work is to study the PTA-DTA problem with general timed-automata specifications.
Another future work is to integrate costs or rewards into this problem.
